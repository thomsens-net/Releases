## Free Trial

You can use Principal Plan without a current license to create and edit files for 60 days. After 60 days, you will need a current license to continue to edit those files. Hopefully, 60 days should give you a chance to see if the software will work for you.

## Read This Before You Upgrade

If your previous license expired before the new version's release date and you want to open files created over 60 days ago, you'll need to renew your license. You can check the license expiration date in Principal Plan's Help/About window to open older files with the new version.
